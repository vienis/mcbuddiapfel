Pressing K will save only ADT file where are you situated! So if you change more than one ADT fly to them and press K to save.
All saved files are in (wow directory)\World\Maps directory. You must make patch-6.MPQ file (as example) and save ADT's here with
three patch (Example: World\Maps\Kalimdor\Kalimdor_1_1.adt).
Also you must use modeleditfix to enter WoW without errors.

Maybe at next releases all will be more simply!

If your program dont startup try to extract files from Fonts.rar to your WoW directory!
Example D:\WoW\Fonts

Enjoy =)
