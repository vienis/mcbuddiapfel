NEW!!!
X - copy selected object
if you copy model, then new model will be created but old one will be selected anyways, so you can simply do many copies!
copying WMO simply bugged... after copying one name manager crashes (fake memory leak... will be fixed soon)
For some time until I fix it I make some trick - when WMO is selected and you press X program automatically save
current tile and reload it - so you can manipulate with new WMO =))
Also because of fake memory you cant do many copies at one time... when you cant select any object it means that your buffer 
is full so you must save map (K) and reload it (J)!

DELETE - will delete current selected model or wmo (I make it in strange but simple way - "z" coordinate of selected object 
becomes -100001 so your model "fall down" and have been unselected... you think your object is deleted but it is not until you
save your map (K-pressed)!) When saving, all models with "z" coord =-100001 just ignoring! lol =)) simple eh?

Esc      - EXIT

Pressing K will save only ADT file where are you situated! So if you change more than one ADT fly to them and press K to save.
All saved files are in (wow directory)\World\Maps directory. You must make patch-6.MPQ file (as example) and save ADT's here with
three patch (Example: World\Maps\Kalimdor\Kalimdor_1_1.adt).
Also you must use modeleditfix to enter WoW without errors.

Maybe at next releases all will be more simply!

If your program dont startup try to extract files from Fonts.rar to your WoW directory!
Example D:\WoW\Fonts

Enjoy =)
